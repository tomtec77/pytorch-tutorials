    "## Autograd: automatic differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Central to all neural networks in PyTorch is the `autograd` package. Let's briefly visit this, and we will then go to train our first neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `autograd` package provides automatic differentiation for all operations on tensors. It is a define-by-run framework, which means that your backprop is defined by how your code is run, and that every single iteration can be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see this in more simple terms with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The class `autograd.Variable` is the central class of the package. It wraps a tensor, and supports nearly all of the operations defined on it. Once you finish your computation you can call `.backward()` and have all the gradients computed automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access the raw tensor through the `.data` attribute, while the gradient with respect to this variable is accumulated into `.grad`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more class which is very important for autograd implementation - a `Function`."
