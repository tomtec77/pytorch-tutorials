    "- Define the neural network that has some learnable parameters (or weights)\n",
    "- Iterate over a dataset of inputs\n",
    "- Process inputs through the network\n",
    "- Compute the loss (how far is the output from being correct)\n",
    "- Propagate gradients back into the network's parameters\n",
